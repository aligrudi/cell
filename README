CELL: A SMALL LINUX SANDBOX
===========================

Cell is a small sandbox using Linux namespaces.  For a list of
available options, invoke cell without any arguments.

The cell.sh script makes a sandbox root directory, and generates a
script to run cell.  To use this script, first modify it to set CELL,
ROOTFS, and ROOTCP variables.  cell.sh creates a user named foe with
UID and GID 99, and home directory /foe.

  # create a sandbox directory (for an overlay, pass lowerdir as well)
  cell.sh /path/to/sandbox

  # execute a shell in the sandbox as foe
  /path/to/sandbox.sh

  # execute a shell in the sandbox as root
  ROOT=1 /path/to/sandbox.sh

You can edit /path/to/sandbox.sh to modify cell options.
